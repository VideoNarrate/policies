# Privacy and cookie policy

*Last updated: 1 February 2022*

The privacy of your data — and it is your data, not ours! — is a big deal to us. In this policy, we lay out: what data we collect and why; how your data is handled; and your rights to your data. We promise we never sell your data.

This policy applies to VideoNarrate and any related service operated by Encoded Knowledge Ltd.

## Our Contact Details

You can contact us by email at [support@videonarrate.com](mailto:support@videonarrate.com), by phone on +44 20 3286 2162, or by post at Encoded Knowledge Ltd, 86-90 Paul Street, London, England, EC2A 4NE. Our Data Protection Officer is Mirko Nasato.

## What we collect and why

Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need. Here’s what that means in practice:

### Identity & access

When you sign up for our product, we typically ask for identifying information such as your name, email address, and maybe a company name. That’s just so you can personalise your new account, and we can send you invoices, updates, or other essential information. We sometimes also give you the option to add a profile picture that displays in our products, but we do not normally look at or access that picture. We’ll never sell your personal info to third parties, and we won’t use your name or company in marketing statements without your permission either.

### Website interactions

When you browse our marketing pages or applications, your browser automatically shares certain information such as which operating system and browser version you are using. We track that information, along with the pages you are visiting, page load timing, and which website referred you for statistical purposes like conversion rates and to test new designs. These statistics are only generated at an aggregate level.

When you are signed into our product we also track interactions at an individual level, tied to your specific account. This includes which actions you perform within our product (such as uploading a video), metadata about your content (such as the video format, resolution, and duration), and how long our servers take to process your content. This is so that we can monitor and improve the performance of our service, and detect potential abuses.

### Cookies

We only use cookies when you sign in to our product, for authentication purposes. These are persistent first-party cookies, so that your signed in status is remembered if you close and reopen your browser. A cookie is a piece of text stored by your browser to help it remember your login information, site preferences, and more. You can adjust cookie retention settings in your own browser. To learn more about cookies, including how to view which cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them, please visit: [www.allaboutcookies.org](https://www.allaboutcookies.org).

### Voluntary correspondence

When you write us with a question or to ask for help, we keep that correspondence, including the email address, so that we have a history of past correspondences to reference if you reach out in the future.

We also store any information you volunteer like surveys. Sometimes when we do customer interviews, we may ask for your permission to record the conversation for future reference or use. We only do so if you give your express consent.

### Information we do not collect

We don’t collect any characteristics of protected classifications including age, race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or physical and mental abilities or disabilities. You may provide these data voluntarily, such as if you include a pronoun preference in your email signature when writing into our Support team.

We also do not collect any biometric data. You are given the option to add a picture to your user profile, which could be a real picture of you or a picture of something else that represents you best. We do not extract any information from profile pictures: they are for your use alone.

## When we access or share your information

Our default practice is to not access your information. The only times we’ll ever access or share your info are:

**To provide products or services you’ve requested**. We do use some third-party services to run our applications and only to the extent necessary process some or all of your personal information via these third parties. You can view the list of third-party services we use for VideoNarrate below. Having subprocessors means we are using technology to access your data. No human looks at your data for these purposes unless an error occurs that stops an automated process from working and requires manual intervention to fix. These are rare cases and when they happen, we look for root cause solutions as much as possible to avoid them from reoccurring.

**To help you troubleshoot or squash a software bug, with your permission.** If at any point we need to access your account to help you with a Support case, we will ask for your consent before proceeding.

**To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding restricted uses.** Accessing a customer’s account when investigating potential abuse is a measure of last resort. We have an obligation to protect the privacy and safety of both our customers and the people reporting issues to us. We do our best to balance those responsibilities throughout the process. If we do discover you are using our products for a restricted purpose, we will report the incident to the appropriate authorities.

**When required under applicable law.**

Encoded Knowledge Ltd is a UK company.

* If competent law enforcement authorities have the necessary warrant, criminal subpoena, or court order requiring we preserve or share data, we have to comply. Otherwise, we reject any such requests. And unless we’re legally prevented from it, we’ll always inform you when such requests are made.
* If we get an informal request from any person, organization, or entity, we do not assist. If you are an account owner who wants to export data from their accounts, please contact our [Support team](mailto:support@videonarrate.com).
* If we are audited by a tax authority, we may be required to share billing-related information. If that happens, we only share the bare minimum needed such as billing addresses and tax exemption information.

Finally, if Encoded Knowledge Ltd is acquired by or merged with another company we’ll notify you well before any info about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

### VideoNarrate subprocessors

We use third party subprocessors, such as cloud computing providers, to run the service.

The following is a list of personal data subprocessors we use.

* [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/gdpr/introduction/). Cloudflare is a US company with a global content distribution network. We do not explicitly store any personal data on Cloudflare, however all web traffic transits via their servers since we use it as a reverse proxy. They also provide us with aggregate-level web analytics.
* [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/security/gdpr/resource-center/). Google is a US company, however we only use their “europe-west2 (London)” datacenter in the UK. We use it to store and process videos and speech.
* [Mailjet](https://www.mailjet.com/security-privacy/), a French company with EU datacenters. We use it to send emails.
* [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/legal/privacy-policy). Hetzner is an EU (German) company. We use their EU datacenters (Germany and Finland) for various cloud computing tasks.
* [Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs/company/privacy). Supabase is a US company, however we only store data in their “West EU (London)” datacenter in the U.K. We use it for authentication and as a general-purpose database.

## Your rights with respect to your information

We apply the same data rights to all customers, regardless of their location. Currently some of the most privacy-forward regulations in place are UK's and European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), and California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) in the US. We recognise all of the rights granted in these regulations, except as limited by applicable law. These rights include:

* **Right to Know.** You have the right to know what personal information is collected, used, shared or sold. We outline both the categories and specific bits of data we collect, as well as how they are used, in this privacy policy.
* **Right of Access.** This includes your right to access the personal information we gather about you, and your right to obtain information about the sharing, storage, security and processing of that information.
* **Right to Correction.** You have the right to request correction of your personal information.
* **Right to Erasure / “To be Forgotten”.** This is your right to request, subject to certain limitations under applicable law, that your personal information be erased from our possession and, by extension, all of our service providers. Fulfillment of some data deletion requests may prevent you from using our services because our applications may then no longer work. In such cases, a data deletion request may result in closing your account.
* **Right to Complain.** You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of your personal information with the appropriate supervisory authority. For the UK this is the [ICO](https://ico.org.uk/).
* **Right to Restrict Processing.** This is your right to request restriction of how and why your personal information is used or processed, including opting out of sale of personal information. (Again: we never have and never will sell your personal data.)
* **Right to Object.** You have the right, in certain situations, to object to how or why your personal information is processed.
* **Right to Portability.** You have the right to receive the personal information we have about you and the right to transmit it to another party.
* **Right to not be subject to Automated Decision-Making.** You have the right to object and prevent any decision that could have a legal, or similarly significant, effect on you from being made solely based on automated processes. This right is limited, however, if the decision is necessary for performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable law, or is based on your explicit consent.
* **Right to Non-Discrimination.** This right stems from the CCPA. We do not and will not charge you a different amount to use our products, offer you different discounts, or give you a lower level of customer service because you have exercised your data privacy rights. However, the exercise of certain rights (such as the right “to be forgotten”) may, by virtue of your exercising those rights, prevent you from using our Services.

If you have questions about exercising these rights or need assistance, please contact us at [support@videonarrate.com](mailto:support@videonarrate.com). For requests to delete personal information or know what personal information has been collected, we will first verify your identity using a combination of at least two pieces of information already collected including your user email address. If an authorized agent is corresponding on your behalf, we will first need written consent with a signature from the account holder before proceeding.

## How we secure your data

All data is encrypted via [SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) when transmitted from our servers to your browser, or between our servers.

Most data are not encrypted while they live in our database (since it needs to be ready to send to you when you need it), but we go to great lengths to secure your data at rest.

## What happens when you delete data in your product accounts

In many of our applications, we give you the option to delete data. Anything you delete on your product accounts while they are active will no longer be accessible via the application, and are deleted from our active servers within the next 30 days.

We also delete your data after an account is cancelled. In this case, your data are purged within 30 days. This applies both for cases when an account owner directly cancels and for auto-cancelled accounts.

## Location of site and data

Our products and other web properties are operated mainly in the United Kingdom, with some processing done in the European Union and the United States. **Please be aware that any information you provide to us may be transferred to the UK, the EU, and/or the US**. By using our Site, participating in any of our services and/or providing us with your information, you consent to this transfer.

- Individuals have the right to access their personal data and to update, correct, and/or amend information that is incomplete. Individuals also have the right to request erasure of personal information that has been processed in violation of the principles. Individuals wishing to exercise these rights may do so by by signing in and directly updating your account information. If you have questions about exercising these rights or need assistance, please contact us at [support@videonarrate.com](mailto:support@videonarrate.com).
- We remain liable for the onward transfer of personal data to third parties acting as our agents unless we can prove we were not a party to the events giving rise to the damages.
-	We do not sell personal data nor do we permit it to be used for reasons other than those for which it was originally provided. If this practice should change in the future, we will update this policy accordingly and provide individuals with opt-out or opt-in choice as appropriate.
-	We may be required to release personal data in response to lawful requests from public authorities including to meet national security and law enforcement requirements.
